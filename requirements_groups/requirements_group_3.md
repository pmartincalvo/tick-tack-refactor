# Requirement group 3

## Intro

The third requirement group adds the option of playing with 3x3 or 4x4 boards. Remember:
you must use the code you built for requirements group 2 as the starting point.


## Specific requirements

Everything that applies to requirement group 2, plus:

- At the beginning of each match, the user gets asked if the board should be 3x3 or 4x4.
- The rules for 4x4 are the same as for 3x3, with the only difference that 4 in a row is required to win.

## Acceptance criteria

The resulting code should provide an experience as follows:
1. Before starting the match, the CLI asks which player should start, and the user can 
give some input to make a choice.
2. The CLI then asks if the board should be 3x3 or 4x4.
3. The rest happens as described in requirements group 2.
