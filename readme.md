# Tick-tack-refactor

# What is this?

Tick-tack-refactor is a small, educational project to improve coding skills. It
works as a hands-on project, suited for beginners (advanced developers with a 
thing for perfectionism might enjoy as well).

The process goes as follow:

1. The project contains a sequence of groups of requirements revolving around 
the tick-tack-toe game. The first group is the minimum necessary to play the 
   game on the CLI. The last group is quite more feature-rich.
   
2. Each group of requirements builds upon the previous state of the code and
adds more and more functionality and features.
   
3. The developer must implement each group of requirements _without checking
   the ones further_. Read only the first group. Implement the minimum necesary
   code to satisfy it. Read only the next one. Implement And so on and so forth.
   
Along with the documentation of the requirement groups, my code solution for each
group is present in the repository. It's not an absolute right, but it can help
you see a possible way to do things, or get you unstuck if some requirement 
catches you low on inspiration. 

_Disclaimer: I'm not a Software Engineer. 
There's a good chance your code ends up being much nicer than mine._

# Where do I start?

You can find the different requirement groups in the `requirements_groups` 
folder. Make yourself comfy in a new project environment, read the first group
and start coding!

Once your code satisfies those requirements, move to the next requirements 
group. You now must grab the code that satisfied the previous group and modify
it to satisfy the additional requirements. **Do not start again from scratch**.
Although you might still learn and have fun, that's not the purpose of the exercise.

As you move through the groups, you can also check the proposed solutions in the `solutions`
folder. Bear in mind they are not absolute truths: if your code satisfies the 
requirements, you've made it. The real success here is living the experience of
modifying your code to satisfy the next requirements group.

# Why have this weird groups thing?

Many educational projects lay down all that ought to be implemented right at 
the start. Although that does not make the exercise bad per se, I believe it
ignores a very real part factor of the day to day life of a software developer:
requirements are a moving target. They change. They grow. Sometimes they are 
not even there.

The goal of tick-tack-refactor is to generate a situation in which, once a set
of requirements has been satisfied, the developer is forced to add new ones 
that will most probably break some bits of his design. 


# Why have you done this?

I've built this because I believe the set of skills needed to refactor and 
adapt code to new requirements is tremendously important. Probably more 
important than being able to code well from scratch in a greenfield project,
since most developers will spend more time modifying existing code rather than
starting out new projects.

Another reason to do this, and not some theoretical stuff, is my strong belief
that certain programming skills can hardly be _explained_. 

I hope this project can help whoever goes through it gather experience and 
tactics in this area and help them improve their coding skills. A
